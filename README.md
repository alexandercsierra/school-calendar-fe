# D8 Picker

https://d8picker22.now.sh/

A scheduling app that allows a user to schedule events in a sporadic pattern and have them automatically added to their personal Google Calendar. Integrated with authentication through Google and the Google Calendar API.

This was a build-on group project where I contributed as a frontend developer. I assisted in the creation of mobile components, and was instrumental in implmenting the mobile design (as given to us by our UX Designer). I also implemented a memoized, smooth-scrolling calendar using a package called React-Window. I also added additional test coverage with Enzyme.
